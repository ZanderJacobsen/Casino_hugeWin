# Casino_freqWin (Phaser 3)

This project is a small interactive casino-style experience built in **Phaser 3**, recreated from an original **Phaser 2 playable ad**. It served as an early step in modernizing legacy Phaser 2 content and exploring Phaser 3’s updated rendering, tweening, and input handling systems.

The gameplay is intentionally simple: it's a one-click “pull-to-win” experience that demonstrates animation timing, visual feedback, and basic state transitions—just like a playable ad would.

## Purpose

This was built as part of an ongoing effort to **rebuild and modernize** a set of Phaser 2 projects originally created for mobile ad formats. It's a technical exercise in:

- Migrating from Phaser 2 to Phaser 3
- Rewriting legacy scene structures into modular formats
- Improving animation and easing control
- Creating easily deployable, self-contained HTML5 builds

---

## Features

- Single-click interaction flow (designed like a playable ad)
- Visual feedback through tweens, movement, and scale animations
- Sound integration for interaction cues
- Tight scene structure and timing loops
- Full Phaser 3 rewrite from an original Phaser 2 version

---

## Skills Demonstrated

- Practical game dev pipeline from legacy tech to modern JS frameworks
- Scene timing and animation sequencing
- Minimalist interaction design (ad-inspired UX)
- Lightweight asset and performance-conscious code structure
- HTML5 deployment and GitHub Pages integration
